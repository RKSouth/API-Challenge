## Getting Started

To use this Api- first fork this repo. Open in VS code - make sure you have the extension, "Rest Client" by Huachao Mao installed. 

Open the terminal and run "npm i" to install the packages (node, express, dotenv and mongoose ). Once, it is finished and you don't have any errors, run "npm run devStart". 

Now you can go to the route.rest file and create, read, update and delete items using the API
